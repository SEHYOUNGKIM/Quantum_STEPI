       " 'National Strategic Overview for Quantum Information Science \\n2 \\n 1 Quantum information science: the next technological revolution \\nQuantum information science (QIS) applies the best  understanding of the sub-atomic world—quantum \\ntheory—to generate new knowledge and technologies. Through developments in QIS, the United States \\ncan improve its industrial base, create jobs, and prov ide economic and national security benefits. Prior \\nexamples of QIS-related technologies include semi conductor microelectronics , photonics, the global \\npositioning system (GPS), and magnetic resonance im aging (MRI). These underp in significant parts of \\nthe national economic and defense infrastructure. Future scientific and technological discoveries from \\nQIS may be even more impactful. Long-running U.S.  Government investments in QIS and more recent \\nindustry involvement have transformed this scientif ic field into a nascent pillar of the American \\nresearch and development enterprise. The Trump ad ministration is committed to maintaining and \\nexpanding American leadership in QIS to enable futu re long-term benefits from, and protection of, the \\nscience and technology created th rough this research. Based on the collective input of all the \\nGovernment agencies invested or interested in QI S, this document presents a national strategic \\napproach to achieving this goal. \\nSpecifically, the United States will create a visi ble, systematic, national  approach to quantum \\ninformation research and development, organized  under a single brand and coordinated by the \\nNational Science and Technology  Council’s (NSTC) Subcommittee on Quantum Information Science \\n(SCQIS). These efforts will leverage existing prog rams and approaches, adapt to the changing and \\nimproving scientific and technical knowledge, refl ect the best understanding of opportunities and \\nchallenges in QIS for the Nation, and take new step s where appropriate. The national effort will:  \\n\\uf0b7 Focus on a science-first approach that aims to  identify and solve Grand Challenges: problems \\nwhose solutions enable transformative  scientific and industrial progress; \\n\\uf0b7 Build a quantum-smart and diverse workforc e to meet the needs of a growing field; \\n\\uf0b7 Encourage industry engagement, providing a ppropriate mechanisms for public-private \\npartnerships; \\n\\uf0b7 Provide the key infrastructure and support needed  to realize the scientific and technological \\nopportunities; \\n\\uf0b7 Drive economic growth; \\n\\uf0b7 Maintain national security; and \\n\\uf0b7 Continue to develop international collaboration and cooperation. \\nThe key next step will be to develop agency-level plans that address the identified approaches and \\npolicy opportunities in the next section, which will be integrated into an overall strategic plan. This will \\nenable new opportunities on a ten-year horizon,  possibly including: the development of quantum \\nprocessors which may enable limited computing applications; new sensors for biotechnology and \\ndefense; next-generation positioning, navigation,  and timing systems for military and commercial \\napplications; new approaches to understanding ma terials, chemistry, and even gravity through \\nquantum information theory; novel algorithms for machine learning and optimization; and \\ntransformative cyber security sy stems including quantum-resistant cryptography in response to \\ndevelopments in QIS.',\n",

       " 'National Strategic Overview for Quantum Information Science \\n5 \\n 3 Challenges this strate gic overview addresses \\nThe rapid growth of QIS and the expectation that th is trajectory will continue over the next decade \\ncreate unique opportunities and challenges for the U.S. research and development enterprise. \\nUnderscoring the Trump Administration’s commitment to advancing QIS, the NSTC elevated its work \\non the subject and established the SCQIS, which has identified four key challenges that need to be \\naddressed with a whole- of-Government response. \\nFirst, improving and facilitating coordination  both within the Government and between public and \\nprivate institutions will create a robust domestic ecosystem and provide worldw ide leadership in this \\ninternational environment. The Nation already has st rong and diverse programs in QIS at the Federal-\\nagency level driven by individual mission spaces, as described in the Appendix. Similarly, companies \\nhave begun making major investments in the field, in spired by the promise of future applications. At \\nthe same time, foreign countries are making invest ments and seeking to build their own QIS base in \\ncompetition with the United States. Coordinating U. S. efforts will take advantage of the Government \\nand industry activities to maintain and accelerate U.S. leadership in QIS. \\nSecond, growth within industry, academia, and Government requires maintaining and expanding a \\nbroad and viable workforce —a quantum-smart workforce—able to  enact critical elements of the \\nresearch and development enterprise. Such a workforc e will attract and retain key jobs throughout the \\nNation, and enable new industrial and academic ef forts that rely upon QIS as a base technology. \\nThird, future progress in QIS requires strong cross-community connections  between disciplines, from \\nphysics to computer science to engineering. Th ese interactions already occur through research \\ncollaborations, but would benefit further from formal  interdisciplinary research and training programs \\nat earlier levels of education. As growth co ntinues, collaborations and cooperation—between \\ndisciplines and nations, between industry and ac ademia—must be promoted, even as competitive \\npressures may make this more difficult. \\nFourth, significant uncertainty remains regarding the overall economic and national security impact of \\nQIS research and development. With strong indust rial engagement now beginning, it is crucial to \\nmaintain a culture of discovery . The likely best-use commercial cases of quantum devices are unknown \\nat this time  and must be found through research. Main taining this focus, despite significant \\ncountervailing pressures, is nece ssary. The technologies that are anticipated to result from this \\napproach may also play a role in solutions to some  of the Nation’s most pressing national security \\nconcerns, but will require maintaining an understand ing of national security implications of QIS. \\nIn order to maintain and expand American leadership in this critical technology given these challenges, \\nwe must improve our capacity for cutting edge re search and development, expand the QIS-literate \\nworkforce, and seamlessly coordinate between gove rnment, academic, and private sector players. \\n4 Choosing a science-first approach to QIS \\nQuantum information science—incl uding concepts and technology  that support revolutionary \\nadvances in computing, communications, and me trology—arises from a synthesis of quantum \\nmechanics and information theory. It examines un iquely quantum phenomena that can be harnessed \\nto advance information processing, transmission, measurement, and fundamental understanding in \\nways that classical approaches can only do much less efficiently, or not at all. Current and future QIS \\napplications differ from prior applications of quantum mechanics, such as the laser, transistor and MRI,',\n",
       " 'National Strategic Overview for Quantum Information Science \\n6 \\n by using distinct quantum phenomena—superpositio n and entanglement—that do not have classical \\ncounterparts.  \\nEven though its origins can be trac ed back to the 1960’s, QIS remains a rapidly evolving scientific and \\nengineering discipline with substantial further di scovery opportunities awaiting. This reflects the \\nGovernment’s long support of basic research and de velopment in this field. Ev en now, while prototype \\nQIS applications, platforms and devices are becomi ng commercially available, new applications and \\nplatforms will likely come from protocols and approaches that are not yet invented. Thus, the \\nGovernment should maintain robust and diverse pl atforms and research thrusts that continue to \\nstimulate transformative and fundamental scientific  discoveries by taking an approach that puts \\nthe science first.  This will require strengthening core research programs and finding new methods to \\nbroaden collaboration and participation.  \\nTo capitalize on QIS-inspired technologies and adva nce the science necessary to realize the associated \\ngains, the development and pursuit of scientific an d applied Grand Challenges will be the unifying \\nstrategy. Grand Challenges are those fundamental scie ntific or technology problems with answers that \\nwill be transformative for Nation and have broad ec onomic and scientific im pact. Potential solutions \\nwill take sustained investments for at least ten year s and require multidisciplinary teams of researchers \\nand technologists. Agencies, academia, and industry must work together to identify and prioritize \\nGrand Challenges, as well as track their progress and reevaluate these scie ntific and technological \\nopportunities as the research and development progress. \\nSolving Grand Challenges and realizing \\nthe potential of QIS will depend on employing effective models of \\ncoordination and collaboration to tap the \\nunique skills and perspectives from \\nFederal agencies, industry, and academia, \\nand to create and maintain a dialogue \\nbetween quantum-focused researchers \\nacross disciplines. Towards this end, \\ncenters and consortia can be a powerful \\nmeans of gathering and maintaining research communities that can sustain \\nsuch long-term, curiosity-driven research. \\nIn addition, the SCQIS’s coordination role \\nas well as mechanisms such as \\nprofessional science and engineering \\nsociety participation, coordinated \\nPrincipal Investigator meetings, and \\ndissemination of information through \\nscientific journals, will help to highlight and share quantum sc ientific advances \\nand to grow the quantum research \\ncommunity.  Grand Challenge  opportunities  \\nQuantum approaches motivated by Gr and Challenges show promise for \\nproviding new capabilities and tools for sensing and metrology, \\ncommunication, simulation, and co mputation. This is vital for \\nfundamental research and promotes security, health, and the economy. \\nFor example, quantum sensing holds the promise to provide advanced \\nsensors for military mission impact, to develop new measurement \\nscience and quantum-based standards, to improve navigation and \\ntiming technologies, and to enviro nmental sensing in novel settings. \\nSingle-photon detectors may become possible at far infrared and \\nmicrowave wavelengths to expand the range of discovery of the dark \\nuniverse, while non-classical emitters could be integrated for sensing, \\ncommunication, and computing systems at room temperature. \\nToday’s noisy intermediate scale q uantum (NISQ) technology will offer \\ninsight into the scientific and technological advances that can address \\nQIS Grand Challenges in areas such as machine learning, simulation of \\nmany-body systems for materials di scovery, chemical processes, \\nquantum field theory, and dynamics of biological processes. Early \\nexploratory efforts in NISQ systems are already yielding new \\nunderstanding of these problems. This can help overcome scientific and',\n",

However, \\nAmerica’s current educational syst em typically focuses on discrete  disciplinary tracks, rarely \\nemphasizing cross-disciplinary study that equips graduates fo r complex modern questions and \\nchallenges, prominently including QIS.  While the responsibility of trai ning students traditionally resides \\nwithin the academic community, Government agenci es and industry can partner with academia to \\nmeet the nation’s future needs.  \\nFundamental research is the main mechanism for gene rating a qualified workforce in QIS. Within the \\ncontext of the need for individuals with a broad mix of skills, support for the trans-sector and trans-\\ndisciplinary approach to research is essential. Stud ents trained in such an environment will be exposed \\nto a diverse yet convergent set of disciplines, alon g with the associated tools and infrastructure. This \\nwill allow students to obtain qualifi cations and skills required by U.S. industry, national laboratories, \\nand academia. Existing approaches of this nature  include special research tracks in academic \\nprograms, early career awards from Government ag encies, support for focused research groups, and \\ncoordinated training with industry. Using and enhanc ing these programs can increase the size of the \\nQIS workforce. Furthermore, approaches that synthesize these programs, such as industrial \\ncollaborations that engaging with a central, fundam ental research program, can prepare students with \\nadditional skills crucial to entering the workforce in  the private sector to further U.S. leadership in \\nquantum science and technology.  \\nAgencies will be encouraged to expand or deve lop specific programs that foster workforce \\ndevelopment and build off each other’s strengths and mission. A number of agencies already have \\nexisting programs, such as the National Science Foundation’s (N SF) Graduate Research Fellowship \\nProgram and the Accelerating Discovery Program;  the National Defense Science and Engineering \\nGraduate Fellowship Program and the Quantum Scie nce and Engineering Program at the Department \\nof Defense (DOD); Science Undergraduate Laboratory internships, the Graduate Student Research \\nProgram, and the Computational Science Graduate Fellowship Program at the Department of Energy \\n(DOE); and the National Institute of Standards and Technology’s (NIST) join t research centers that \\ncombine Government researchers with university st udents, postdoctoral scholars, and faculty. These \\nprograms can be enriched, modified, and expa nded when driven by agency need. Further \\nimprovements may include joining existing efforts of different agencies to increase impact, such as by \\ncreating joint early-career programs.  \\nLooking to the longer-term horizon, academic fa culty provide the bedrock of training programs. \\nUniversities should be encouraged to address the workforce development needs by adding tenured or \\ntenure-track faculty within the in terdisciplinary themes associated  with QIS and consider Quantum \\nScience and Engineering as a discipline for future co ncentration, exemplified in  steps such as creating \\nnew departments or thesis tracks. Other avenue s include new undergraduate programs, engagement \\nwith industry and Government for internships and externships—predominantly for U.S. persons—and \\nnew professional development programs, including  encouragement for creation of specialized \\ntechnical programs. These students become ambassado rs of their discipline while following a wide \\nrange of different paths in their ca reers, increasing the societal impa ct of quantum-science education. \\nBeyond the university, outreach to a broader audi ence will be essential.

At the same \\ntime, informal education tools, such as \\nthose found in many museums across the Nation, are effective and complementary to the classroom. These overall efforts work best in \\ncoordination with the NSTC Committee on STEM and its subcommittees that address STEM and related \\neducation. \\nWorkforce generation efforts and future U.S. workfo rce needs of the nascent quantum industry should \\nbe periodically assessed, through in dustrial engagement (described in the following section) and work \\nwith established STEM efforts. This information can help guide future programs to produce the diverse \\nworkforce needed to support the quantum ecosystem.  In order to improve the workforce development \\nprogram over time, an assessment plan of quantum  workforce development activities should be \\nencouraged to allow participants to select and ex pand the most successful strategies and adapt, \\nchange, or terminate what does not work. Collaborati on with professional societies and organizations, \\nindustrial consortia, and local governments ar e other means of assessi ng workforce needs. \\n6 Deepening engagement wi th quantum industry \\nThe revolutionary advances expected to come fr om QIS have already led to substantial industry \\nattention on QIS research and development. Both la rge companies and a variety of startups and small \\nbusinesses are investing heavily in quantum sensing, networking, computing, and supporting \\ntechnologies. Several have already realized or wi ll soon unveil next-generation quantum sensors, \\nentanglement distribution over small networks, an d quantum processors in the 50-qubit range, with \\nplans to continue on a rapid-grow th trajectory. In view of the economic and national security \\nimportance of QIS the Government will develo p means to coordinate with U.S. industry. \\nA critical element in a robust quantum ecosystem is a strong base of quantum-essential supporting \\ntechnologies that are not intrinsically quantum in  themselves. Current examples include cryogenics, \\nphotonics, low-noise microwave amplif iers, and nanofabrication. Thus the consortium should work to \\nidentify and stay abreast of these evolving needs,  as well as work in partnership with Government \\nagencies and industry to nurture and grow these techno logies in cases where they are weak or do not \\nyet exist. Existing approaches such as SBIR and STTR programs that promote innovation for small \\nbusinesses can be integrated with or combined with other approaches such as joint research centers.  \\nIn addition, as a key mechanism for industry engage ment, the Government should foster the formation \\nof a U.S. Quantum Consortium with participants fr om industry, academia, and Government. Like prior \\nconsortia such as the Semiconductor Research Co rporation, a consortium provides a forum for \\ntechnical exchanges and discussions to establish a mutual understanding of QIS industry’s trajectory, \\nopportunities, and critical technical gaps and proj ected needs (e.g., for work force, infrastructure, \\nstandards, and road-mapping). Furthermore, the cons ortium can also provide a venue for joint public-\\nprivate funding to address infrastructure and tech nology gaps, and key pre-competitive research and Improving  academic-industrial  pathways   \\nOne program that is expanding connect ions across sectors is the recently \\ndeveloped NSF-funded Quantum Information Science and Engineering \\nNetwork, https://qisenet.uc hicago.edu/, also know n as “TRIPLETS.” This \\neffort promotes small research projects executed by American graduate \\nstudents over a course of 3 years in close collaboration with an academic',\n",

For a meaningful \\ncollaboration environment to exist,  intellectual property concerns wi ll also need to be addressed and \\nmethods for realizing the development technology emphasized where possible. \\n7 Providing critical infrastructure \\nThe successful development of technologies based on  QIS will enable increasingly more advanced \\nquantum research, but hinges on the availability of suitable tools, fa cilities, and other infrastructure \\nitems. The QIS research and development enterprise  is not yet large enough to sustain an industry \\nfocused on developing and supplying all the necessa ry infrastructure. A targeted expansion of the \\nrelevant Federal and industrial infrastructure and s upport activities is needed to accelerate progress \\nand prepare Federal agencies and industry to adopt the ensuing quantum technologies.  \\nThe U.S. Government can play a critical role in fost ering this field by encouraging programs that target \\nthe development and fielding of supporting technolo gies, ranging from component technologies all the \\nway to sophisticated fabrication and characterizati on technologies. Agencies will be encouraged to \\nexplore mechanisms to provide the QIS research community with increased access to existing and \\nfuture Federal facilities, including manufacturing fa cilities that can be repurposed and expanded as \\nwell as systems and testbeds for post-quantum a pplications.

The \\nGovernment will engage with experts and \\nstakeholders, as well as industry and \\nacademia, to identify critical \\ninfrastructure and map the current \\ninfrastructure landscape. For example, the \\nU.S. Quantum Consortium can help \\ndetermine which of the component technologies will have a sufficient \\neconomic base to encourage industrial \\ndevelopment, can help develop industry \\nengagement with post-quantum \\napplications, and can also periodically track prog ress and tap external expertise to evaluate the \\neffectiveness of investments being made. In accordan ce with evolving needs, these efforts should be \\non-going. \\nIn addition to bolstering infrastructure, it is import ant to nurture the adoption of quantum technologies \\nwithin the Federal Government by cultivating pote ntial end-user agencies. A culture of information \\nsharing has sprung up organically among the perso nnel at the Federal agencies funding QIS and those \\nlooking to leverage future applications. The Gove rnment will encourage this culture, and the inter-\\nagency process will provide a soundi ng board for promulgating such shared interest and promoting the \\nleveraging of Federal investments in advancing ea ch agency’s mission. Furthermore, it will explore \\nmethods to spur engagement from those end-user agencies that have not yet played a role in \\ndeveloping the technology, but could benefit from th e output of this research. Indeed, the impact of \\nQIS will be felt broadly, and it will be important for each agency to be aware of how the quantum \\nrevolution may augment its mission space. The establ ishment of end-user testbed facilities along with \\ntraining and engagement will allow Federal agencies and stakeholders to explore relevant applications.  Enabling the next generation of quantum science  \\nQuantum states are extraordinarily fragile, and successfully using them \\nfor applications will require an un precedented level of control and \\nsophistication. For this reason, QI S will require new classes of high-\\nperformance classical components and instrumentation capable of \\nrealizing these exacting requiremen ts. These components will cover a \\nbroad range of technologies and systems, from ultra-cold cooling \\nsystems, to precision electronic and optical systems, and even rather \\nbasic components like cables approp riate for carrying quantum signals. \\nThe lack of suitable and reliable classical components and equipment is \\none of the biggest hurdles to surmount in attempting to realize useful QIS \\ndevices.  \\nIn addition, progress in certain areas of QIS is already limited by the \\nunavailability of specialized materi als and advanced technologies for \\nmaterials characterization. For example, unknown dynamics on the \\nmetal surfaces of ion traps limit th e performance of ion-based qubits. \\nRecently, U.S. researchers made use of a Rapid Access Proposal to Oak \\nRidge’s Center for Nanophase Materi als Science to access a series of \\nsophisticated tools for surface char acterization to better understand \\nthese defects.  \\nQuantum devices also require sophisticated fabrication capabilities. For \\ninstance, over the past decade, access to the Microsystems and \\nEngineering Sciences Application (MESA)  fabrication facility has allowed \\nSandia National Laboratories to deve lop and mature ion trap devices to',\n",

At the same time, creating new markets and industries enhance our ability to \\naddress national security needs, but the scientific and economic advances can lead to new risks. An \\nappropriate balance between growth and risk can provide long-term benefits. \\nThe technologies that are anticipated to result fr om intensified research and development in QIS may \\nprovide solutions to some of the nation’s most pr essing national security concerns. For example, \\nadvancements in quantum computing may allow fo r improvements in effective drug discovery, \\nmodeling of chemical reactions to enhance corros ion-resistant materials, and optimizing logistics \\nsolutions. These and other opportunities in networking  and sensing can play a positive role in ensuring \\nnational security and defense. \\nHowever, there may be challenges to public safe ty and security that arise from these same \\ntechnologies.

This \\nstatus as a leader in quantum research and develo pment is a direct result of the U.S. Government \\nfunding agencies and institutions sustained investme nt in basic and applied research. Both broad and \\nfocused programs, built atop a foundation of well-st affed and well-equipped research institutions, have \\ncreated a talented workforce, encouraged broad innovation and exploration, and dedicated the \\nnecessary hard work in physics, ma terials science, and associated ar eas necessary to make progress in \\nthe development of working, controllable quantum syst ems.

The national strategic approach should continue to \\nleverage these strengths of both the U.S. Gove rnment funding system and the U.S. innovation \\necosystem. \\nFinally, significant contributions to  QIS research have been made in other countries. The field has \\nadvanced in the United States in some part by recruiting, collaborating, an d competing with science \\naround the world.

E xamples such as a tomic clocks \\nfor Global Positioning System  (GPS)  navigation,  and nuclear spin control for m agnetic resonance \\nimaging (MRI) are widely  used  already , with transformative  impact s for society . In the near future, \\nQuantum Information Science and Technology (QIST) can enable a new  generation of similarly \\ntransformative sensors. Furthermore, this process  can be accelerated  if concerted efforts  are prioritized  \\nas a part of the National  Quantum Initiative  (NQI) . \\nSeveral  challenges  must be overcome  to transition QIST -based  sensors  from  the lab to market  and into \\nvarious mission  space s. Cooperation among  industry, academia, and U.S. departments and a gencies  \\n(here inafter agencies)  can facilitate the requisite science and engineering , especially if a shared vision \\nand mutually beneficial goals are identified . Appropriate partnerships can catalyze  progress by  linking \\nresearchers with potential end users to  co-design and field -test prototypes. To this end , \\nrecommendations  are presented  here to coordinate research and development (R&D)  and  facilitate \\nfruitful application s for quantum sensors . The National Science and Technology Council Subcommittee \\non Q uantum Information Science should leverage its interagency working groups to facilitate  the \\nappropriate implement ation of  the following recommendations : \\n1. Agencies leading QIST R&D  should  accelerate the development of  new quantum sensing  \\napproaches  and prioritize  appropriate partnerships with end users to elevate the technology \\nreadiness of  new  quantum sensors.  \\n2. Agencies that use sensors  should conduct feasibility studies and jointly test quantum \\nprot otypes with QIST R&D leaders to identify  promising technologies and to focus on quantum \\nsensors that address their a gency mission.  \\n3. Agencies that support engineering R&D  should develop  broadly applicable  components and \\nsubsystems,  such as compact reliable lasers  and integrated optics , to facilitate the \\ndevelopment of quantum technologies and promote  economies of scale.   \\n4. Agencies should  streamline technology transfer and acquisition practices to encourage the \\ndevelopment and early adoption of quantum sensor  technologies . \\nThese r ecommendations  augment the U.S.  strategy for QIST  by build ing upon the National Strategic \\nOverview for Quantum Information Science and the NQI  Act.

Introduction   \\nDue  to their improved accuracy, stability, sensitivity , and precision, q uantum sensors offer some \\nadvantages over  traditional  technologies . In addition , quantum  measurement devices and modalities  \\nwithout classical counterpart s enable some tasks that were previously unfeasible . For example , single \\natomic spins can map magnetic  fields  with nanometer resolution . Matter -wave interferometers can \\nmonitor gravitational fields with unprecedented accuracy . Entanglement and  many -body quantum \\nstates  may enable even more  profound  capabilities , such as  non -invasive imaging  or measurement \\nprecision  beyond the standard quantum limit. However , realiz ing such new technology and deriv ing \\nmajor benefits  for society  can take years or even decades  of innovation . A goal of  the National Quantum \\nInitiative ( NQI ) is to accelerate this  process  and bring  more  quantum sensors to fruition.  \\nSuccessful e xemplars  of quantum sensors include  atomic clocks , which have many applications \\nincluding  GPS navigation, and  also  magnetic resonance  imaging (MRI) scanners , which  are widely used \\nin medicine. Beyond these well- known  cases , quantum sensors at  various stages of development  are \\non the horizon , and some will offer  disruptive  capabilities  for industry , defense, and science . However, \\nit is difficult to predict which platforms will become most useful , as translating research  from  the lab to \\nmarket can take long and  circuitous pathways .1 To wit, the inventors of early atomic clocks  probably \\nnever envisioned the advent of the ride  hailing and food delivery apps that currently use atomic clocks  \\nto facilitate pick -up and drop- off via GPS navigation . In a s imilar  spirit , tomorrow’s enterprises may \\nleverage novel  quantum sensors for  applications  that are not yet foreseen . \\nCrossing the “valley of death ,” i.e., maturing proof -of-principle prototypes into  economically viable \\ndevices , requires overcoming many hurdles.2 Careful handoffs  are needed  between funding a gencies, \\nscientists , engineers, innovators, investors, manufacturers, and end  users . Still, as with m any emerging \\ntechnologies, revolutionary innov ations may fail to find a market for many reasons. Obstacles include \\ncompetition with more familiar classical technologies, and the often incremental  or iterative process of \\nimproving the size, weight, power and  cost (SW aP-C), and functionality of devices. Cycles of \\ndevelopment often  require s ubstantial  and long -term efforts to reengineer  key components. Even after  \\nbusiness concepts are identified , supply chains requir e time  to establish. E conomies of scale can be \\nelusive  and m ay depend on other sectors . Navigating these challenges requires synergistic actions \\namong  academic, industrial , and government actors , which can be  orchestrate d with sound policy . \\nThe p olicy recommendations presented here  are designed to  address gaps where coordination is \\nneeded and can substantial ly accelerate the discovery, development, and  utilization  of quantum \\nsensors.

However, the vast space \\nof possible applications and the broad range of quantum tech nologies  illustrated in this Section  causes \\nchallenge s which will be discussed in the next Section . For example,  quantum sensor R&D efforts are \\nsomewhat  diffuse and unfocussed ; many  quantum sensor concepts are  at low levels  of technology \\nreadiness ; and many  sensor concepts still require substantial engineering  with commensurately \\nsubstantial funding for the development of key components .

Recommendations  for Bringing  Quantum Sensors to  Fruition  \\nSensing  is arguably the most mature sub category of quantum  technology . In comparison, quantum \\ncomput ing and quantum networ king  are at earlier , albeit  dynamic , stage s of development.  Given the \\nstate of play , several quantum sensors appear poised to  produce  impacts for society  in the near -term , \\nprovided that some  key challenges can be  overcome. Furthermore, R&D associated with the NQI  can be \\ninstrumental for the realizing the full benefit of  quantum sensors . The United States can  spur \\ndevelopment of quantum sensors  with actions recommended in  this Section . \\nChallenges to Address:  Bringing new quantum sensors from proof -of-concept designs to fieldable \\nproducts  still require s overcoming  many hurdles. Key challenges are briefly summarized here. For one, \\nthe vast application space and wide variety of potential user requirements makes it difficult to focus \\nwork on specific applications  or requirements . Furthermore, the market drivers and commercial value  \\nof m any  quantum sensors are  still being determined.  Hence, R&D efforts are diffuse. Meanwhile, the \\nlong road from basic research  to successful products  requires substantial and sustained funding, often \\nwith several coord inated thrusts . Given  the varied needs of different user communities, a long -term \\nstrategy should  be developed to align multiple agencies and unite private sector stakeholders around  \\nthe development of  some particular  applications and  key supporting technologies. A cohesive, system -\\nwide approach is especially important  for R&D efforts that may be too costly for any single a gency , \\nuniversity , or company  to sustain on their own. Additional c oordination with the p rivate sector to \\nefficiently mature quant um technologies  across the valley of death may benefit from coordinated \\nefforts to identify and disseminat e effective practices  for managing intellectual property, acquisition s, \\nresearch security , and appropriate partnerships . Innovation -friendly practices  can facilitate  spin -off \\ntechnologies and companies , and a robust ecosystem  for technology transfer.  \\nFour policy recommendations to address these challenges are presented in Box 7. To facilitate \\nimplementing these recommendations , the NSTC  Subcommittee on QIS  and  its interagency working \\ngroups  should  help  coordina te supporting actions  discuss ed throughout this Section . \\nBox 7: Recommendations to Facilitate the Development and Utilization of Quantum Sensors  \\n1. Agencies leading QIST R&D  should accelerate the development of new quantum sensing \\napproaches and prioritize appropriate partnerships with end users to elevate the \\ntechnology readiness of  new  quantum sensors . \\n2. Agencies that use sensors  should conduct feasibility studies and jointly test quantum \\nprototypes with QIST R&D leaders to identify promising technologies and to focus on \\nquantum sensors that address their a gency mission . \\n3. Agencies that support engineering R&D  should develop broadly applicable components and \\nsubsystems, such as compact reliable lasers and integrated optics, to facilitate the \\ndevelopment of quantum technologies and promote economies of scale.  \\n4.

This includes familiarity with current  (competing ) \\ntechnologies  and the rigors of deploying sensors in operational  environments. Finding experts  and end \\nusers  with that compl ementary knowledge can be challenging, and the payoff may require long  \\nduration s with  many cycles of development.  These t imeframes  may not align neatly with criteria for \\npromotion and tenure. The  (perceived) lack of programmatic resources or a gency support for new joint \\nprojects can slow progress . It is also difficult to forecast if or when experiments and demonstrations will \\nlead to commercially  or scientifically relevant devices  or help agencies accomplish their mission s. \\nDiscussion of Recommendation: Agencies leading QIST R&D, such as NIST, NSF, DOE, DOD, NASA, and \\nthose within the  intelligence community , should engage with potentia l end  users for quantum sensor \\nprototypes to jointly test, develop, and disseminate findings  for end -user  applications.  The goal for this \\nrecommendation is to accelerate  fundamental R&D , testing , and utilization of prototypes. These \\nagencies should seek appropriate partnerships with end users in U.S. Government, industry, and \\nacademia who can apply quantum technologies to improve the way technology consumers  accomplish \\ntheir respective goals or missions. Field testing and early adoption of select  relevant  exemplars should  \\nstimulate developers to work on the most important specifications and functionality. At the same time, \\njoint efforts should benefit the end  users by providing new capabilities, first -mover advantages, and an \\nincreasing awareness of emerging technologies. Collaborations of this nature should  also create \\nopportunities to invest in use -inspired basic research and pioneer  entirely new applications .  \\nA first step for engaging end  users is to share information, for example, at workshops, professional \\nconferences, and  through  follow -up discussions  and publications . Educating agency leadership, field \\nscientists, and program officers about the capabilit ies of quantum sensors can be done with briefings, \\nseminars, and working groups. Quantum 101 briefings can provide an overture or foothold for further \\ndiscussions. While  some agencies have engaged  in the development of quantum sensors for decades, \\nthis knowledge can still be siloed within a few laboratories or divisions. Hence, sharing information \\nabout emerging quantum sensors with end  users and a gency leadership across the U.S. Government is \\nan i mportant step. This  professional outreach  can include staff at national laboratories, DOD \\nlaboratories, and a broad list of a gencies that could utilize quantum sensors, including, e.g., NASA, NIH, \\nDHS, NOAA, USGS, USDA, and DOT. Recognizing the ongoing and  compl ementary work being done \\naround the globe on quantum sensors and component technologies,  international cooperation should \\nbe leveraged  as appropriate . Memoranda of u nderstanding  (MOUs) and a greement  (MOAs ), or annexes \\nto existing MOUs and MOAs , should be encouraged as a means to  formaliz e collaborations  and identify \\nroles and responsibilities.   \\nOvercoming barriers  to these types of collaboration s may require  cultural shift s within a gencies and \\nacademia.  For example, promotion and tenure committees could acknowled ge a wide r variety of \\ncontributions to QIST development and not restrict  professional reward solely to projects with neatly \\npackaged milestones  or publications .

Unrealistic expectations or misundersta ndings about potential applications  are unfortunately \\ncommon  consequences . There are also potential end  users who are unaware  of the existence of certain \\nquantum sensors, leading  to missed opportunities.  Prior to developing economies of scale, it is difficult \\nto project  when or if lab demonstrations will become commercially  viable  or help a gencies accomplish \\ntheir missions. Comparisons with existing,  classical alternatives and benchmarks are  not \\nstraightfo rward , for example, because classical sensors may have decades of R&D . These  challenges  \\ncomplicate  seeing ahead  to competitive device s that can be supported by procurement . Satisfying \\nSWaP-C constraints for quantum sensors may depend on supporting technology that is still undergoing \\nfundamental R&D, which may give the false impression that a given quantum sensor concept will never \\nbe viable. Furthermore, the practical value of a sensor depends on many factors , including performance \\nin real -world env ironments.  Specifications such as r esponse to environmental noise, reliability, \\nbandwidth, duty -cycle, and operational dead time are important, but often  are not the first priority for \\nscientists or inventors  to optimize in early prototypes. Yet t hese fact ors are highly relevant for field \\ndeployment . Hence,  potential end users should  help to judge this trade -space. \\nDiscussion of Recommendation:  Agencies u sing  sensors should  identify a few relevant quantum \\ntechnologies  and  investigate them with dedicated efforts , invoking partnerships , MOUs , and MOAs  as \\nappropriate . Potential end-user agencies (consumers) within the U.S. G overnment could include DHS, \\nNIH, USDA, USGS, NOAA, as well as components of DOE, DOD, and NASA that might be initially outside of the QIS T research ecosystem . National laboratories\\n, federally funded R&D  centers , and scientists in \\nacademia could be early adopters  as well.  Joint efforts among QIST  R&D practitioners  and these end \\nusers can be prioritized to field -test, co -design, and develop new quantum sensor prototypes and \\napplications.  Agencies can use the SC QIS and its working groups to help identify potential partnerships.  \\nTime and resources should be allocated to encourage agency staff to collaborate with QIST  R&D leaders \\nin other government a gencies, the private sector, and academic research institutions, both \\ndomestically and internationally . Attention  should be given  to potentially disruptive technologies . \\nEstablishing  collaborations  early in the R&D process will help to explore the  value added from quantum \\nmodalities, recognizing that revolutionary  approaches  often take time to produce  results.  These efforts \\nshould a ssess the impact of quantum sensing to end -user agency  missions , and prioritize use cases \\nwhere quantum sensors address unsolved capability gaps or result in large -scale  improvements .  \\nFeasibility studies  should  result in reports  with actionable plans and recommendations for developing \\nquantum sens ing technologies , along with descriptions of use cases with requirements or metrics that \\nwould need to be met for new sensors to impact an a gency or research area.

Unfortunately, many of \\nthese enabling technologies do  not yet have a sufficiently large market to  realize economies of scale . \\nThese obstacles  delay  the development of the required subsystems  and create  challeng es to deliver ing \\nfunctionality  to end  users without several  iterations and subsequent refinements . \\nDiscussion of Recommendation:  Agencies that support engineering R&D should work with the SCQIS  \\nand its working groups to identify ways to facilitate  the development of  key components that are \\nneeded to  make quantum sensors more compact, reliable, and cost -effective. Explor ing joint efforts  \\nwith industry  and  making targeted investments in infrastructure can produce cross -cutting,  multi -\\nfuncti onal components that  enable several quantum  devices , such as  reliable lasers at applicable \\nwavelengths and integrated optics circuits . Agencies should c oord inate  strategic  R&D investments in \\nthese enabling technologies , to build joint ventures  and talent that  will foster a sustainable quantum \\nindustr ial base . \\nA consortium or incubator that can manage small  volume production runs  (10 - 100 units) would  fill a \\ngap  and provide infrastructure needed  for rapid prototyping . There is also a demand  for foundries  that \\ncan produce integrated optics with new materials  for chip -scale devices . A collaboration space for \\nnanofabrication experts and non -experts to work together on designs would benefit this endeavor.  \\nCompelling  applications that justify dedicated engineering efforts  can help  to guide infrastructure \\ndevelopment. In parallel,  the QIST community can continue to  leverag e adaptable components  that \\nmay be originally developed for other  areas , e.g., photonics, microelectronics, or nanotech nology .  \\nCoordinat ing both of these approach es - versatile components for compelling applications  - may  \\npresent opportunities to seed QIST -related infrastructure in the broader marketplace, where economic \\nmotivations for maturi ng subsystem technologies can be stronger than what QIST application s alone \\nmight  generate . Synergies among QIST and other technical sectors can provide mutual benefits.  \\nIndustry  engagements  can leverage  appropriate  partnerships  through Small Business Innovation \\nResearch (SBIR)  and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs , centers of excellence, the \\nNSF Innovation Corps programs, academic liaisons with industry,  industry/university cooperative \\nresearch centers , and national laboratories. P rocu rement, technology transfer, and connections with \\nconsortia such as the Quantum Economic Development Consortium ( QED -C) can  also improve the \\nsupply chain for components  and enabling technolog ies.  \\nOvercoming certain technical hurdles may require multiple  agencies to agree upon, and work towards , \\nshared long -term vision s.

       " 'BRINGING  QUANTUM  SENSORS TO  FRUITION  \\n13 \\n Recommendation 4: Agencies should streamline technology transfer and acquisition practices to \\nencourage the development and early adoption of quantum sensor technologies . \\nChallenges Addressed: Some practices pertaining to intellectual property protection can impede or \\ndiscourage cooperation, with these challenges becoming  even greater for international engagements. \\nSimilarly, well- intended restrictions on procurement can delay acquisitions and slow development, in \\nsome cases reducing competitiveness. A balanced approach is therefore needed to ensure r esearch \\nsecurity while maintaining the core values behind America’s scientific leadership, including openness, \\ntransparency, honesty, equity, fair competition, objectivity, and democratic principles. While threats to \\nresearch security are serious , there is  also a risk that  the overly broad implementation of protections  \\ncould  inhibit the flow of information that drives progress.  \\nDiscussion of Recommendation:  Agencies should identify and implement helpful practices for  \\nresolving  technology transfer issues  such as source selection, purchasing authority, licensing \\nagreements , and conflicts of interest . Efficient technology transfer and acquisition processes are vital \\nfor innovation. They can reduce administrative barriers for inventors to explore commercial v iability, \\nhelp end  users access and co- develop products, and make public -private partnerships more \\nstraightforward. With public trust being paramount, e nsur ing that decisions are made in a manner that \\nappropriatel y facilitates  innovation an d basic research, while reduc ing administrative burdens, can \\nfoster rapid innovation . To this end , agencies should thoughtfully consider  their tolerance for \\ntechnological or operational risk s, while accounting for  laws  and  norms, and  maintaining research \\nsecurity best practices . As technology transfer depends on many people in different parts of \\ngovernment,  the private sector, and academia,  one approach is to engage  the SCQIS, the NSTC Lab to \\nMarket Subcommittee , and their working groups to identify and share best practices . \\nPotential  frameworks may include hybrid institutes and consortia that facilitate collaboration among \\nentities,  including  those  between government and private sector scientists . Start -ups and small \\nbusinesses  may benefit from standardized, possibly shared, government pre -approved mechanisms for \\nhandling a range of issues from intellectual property to immigration and investor relations . Advance \\nmarket commitments for components or devices can incentivize early stage manufacturing of quantum \\ntechnologies .47 Other incentives may invoke government grants for user groups, shared infrastructure, \\nor pre -competitive research to kick -start the development of enabling technologies .

Quantum sensing technologies have  already  led to advances in  fields such as:  \\nposition ing, navigation,  and timekeeping ; remote sensing; biomedical, chemical , and materials \\nsciences; and fundamental physics. Some successful examples  required decades of  careful \\ninvestments , and a sometimes -circuitous  series of theoret ical and experimental developments, as well \\nas sustained R&D  efforts  across multiple a gencies and the private sector . The return on investment is \\nevident from  technologies , such as GPS and MRI , that are provid ing transformative impacts for society  \\nand advancing the frontiers of knowledge.  \\nThe realization of new quantum sensors is a tangible, near -term objective that should  be catalyzed  by \\nagencies represented on the Subcommittee on QIS as part of the National Quantum Initiative  program . \\nGetting mor e quantum sensors to market is a goal that can lay a foundation for industries of the future \\nand provide disruptive advantages for prosperity and security.  Similar to the technological arcs \\ndescribed by the highlighted exemplars in Section II, these effort s wi ll open new horizons and expand \\nthe reach of fundamental science and engineering.  \\nAn overarching strategy that engages several a gencies, private sector entities, and academic leaders is \\nimportant because there are potentially valuable quantum sensing technologies  that are still  \\nvulnerable  to failure . Opportunities can be missed for lack of  communication  between researchers and \\nend  users, underdeveloped supply chains , or insufficient engineering support for key components . \\nChallenges also stem from barriers to technology transfer , tendencies to avoid risk, and the fact that \\ntimelines can be quite long to develop functional devices.  \\nThe four policy recommendations presented in Section III augment and expand upon the National \\nStrategic Overview for QIS  and  provide specific approaches to overcome  several of the main  challenges \\nfacing quantum sensor  developers . A concerted effort will help to identify mission -relevant quantum \\nsensor s, understand  the performance requirements dictated by application s, anticipate fundamental \\nlimitations and failure modes for device s in realistic conditions, and  take appropriate risks to  explore  \\ntruly revolutionary technologies.  It will take leadership to facilitate collaboration s between QIST  R&D \\nagencies and potential  end  users, and to identify appropriate budgets for these activities.  \\nWhile there is much fundamental science to be done, and entirely new concepts and platforms for \\nquantum sensors are likely to be discovered  in the future , the strategy presented here has  focused on \\njoint efforts and  field -testing of  prototypes  because these have been identified as gaps where  \\ncoordination  is needed and successes can bolster the entire field of QIST . Existing  mechanisms that \\nenable early -stage exploratory QIST  research  are an important source of new ideas and should not be \\nsupplanted by these recommendations .

QNs in the form of internets or intranets enable larger quantum computation s \\nby connecting  quantum computers  together . Entangled sensor networks may enable precision \\nmetrology beyond  what is possible with the best individua l quantum sensors. Q uantum properties can \\nalso be utilized to secure communication in novel ways. These promises  of new science and technology \\nmotivate active research into creating  and understanding  QNs and their constituent components.  \\nThe fundamental applications, basic building blocks , and ultimate value  proposition s for QNs are still \\nimmature. Misunderstanding abounds. QN s cannot provide faster -than- light communication nor can \\nQNs  teleport material objects.  Although research continues on secure forms of communication that are \\nimpervious to hacking by a quantum computer, there exist classical solutions —so-called post-quantum \\ncryptography (PQC )—which  are already  in active development for deployment.

       " 'A COORDINAT ED APPROACH  TO QUANTUM  NETWORKING  RESEARCH  \\n1 \\n Introduction  \\nQuantum mechanics enables capabilities beyond those that can be achieved with classical methods . \\nOver the past century, harnessing quantum aspects of nature  has produced  essential  technolog ies such \\nas lasers,  transistors , magnetic resonance  spectroscopy , and atomic clocks . These  technologies  have  \\ntremendous impact on society , enabling today’s  internet, computers, medical imaging, and GPS \\nnavigation. Looking towards the future, the scientific and engineering community has shown that \\nexploiting deeper, more esoteric properties of quantum mechanics, such as quantum  superposition, \\nentanglement,  and measurement  has profound implications for information processing, \\ncommunications, remote sensing,  and basic science , and may lead to a technological revolution.  Past \\nexperience with disruptive advances suggests that applications envision ed today for quan tum \\ntechnologies may  be dwarfed by not -yet-imagined discoveries that may be developed in industry, \\nacademia, and government labs  in the U nited States  and around the world.  Early and sustained \\nexplorations that pioneer the application of these quantum prope rties will promote U .S. leadership in \\nthis emergent field and provide advantages for the Nation’s economy , security , and innovation \\necosystem.  \\nA quantum network’s  greatest value comes from its ability to distribute entanglement. A  unique  \\nproperty of quantum objects such as atoms or photons , entanglement is a fundamental physical \\nresource for both probing scientific questions and  for the development of advanced quantum \\ninformation technologies. Perfectly e ntangled objects behave as  a single quantum state regardless of \\nhow far apart they are  and manifest  correlations that cannot be obtained classically. Q uantum \\nnetworks  provide a mechanism to coherently interconnect quantum devices  so they work as a united \\nquantum system , and can thus achieve goals that are impossible or impractical with classical \\ntechnology.  \\nQuantum networks will  one day be able to distribute entanglement across several nodes  that  are \\ncomposed of different quantum technologies , separated by a range of physical distances. Local \\nquantum ne twork s (intranets) may require diverse components such as quantum interconnects  and  \\nquantum memories . Terrestrial quantum networks may include ground -, air -, and sea- based platforms . \\nSome applications may benefit from satellites with quantum networking pla tforms in orbit. M ost \\nquantum protocols require support from a classical layer , so interfacing a quantum network with \\nclassical components will be critical . A fully  functional network will require advancements in several \\nenabling technologies such as sources, detectors, transducers, and repeaters for quantum states of \\nlight and matter. Cost- benefit determinations and decisions to develop particular technologies will \\ndepend on a deeper understanding of the underlying concepts of quantum systems and on the \\nanticipated applications.  \\nCutting -edge Quantum Information Science and Engineering ( QISE ) research is needed in order to \\naddress  the challenge s of generating , distribu ting , and utilizing quantum entanglement . As \\nsummarized in A Strategic Vision for America’s Quantum Networks1 and the Quantum Frontiers Report2, \\nresearch efforts to develop foundational components , enabl e quantum state transduction , \\ninterconnect quantum devices , and  explore new use cases for quantum networking  are required .

Presently, the  realm of quantum networking  \\ntechnology that remains to be explored is very large, and the field is in a n exploratory phase of research \\nand discovery . \\nUnderstanding Quantum Networking  \\nThe term quantum networking  encompasses more than its most commonly known forerunner of  quantum \\nkey distribution (QKD). QKD is a specific communications protocol that has stimulated research and \\ndevelopment (R&D), but its value in real applications faces significant challenges3. Quantum networking is \\nalso quite different from post -quantum cryptography (PQC), which consists of classical algorithms operating \\non classical computers. As described by the National Institute of St andards and Technology (NIST), “The goal \\nof post -quantum cryptography, also called quantum -resistant cryptography, is to develop cryptographic \\nsystems that are secure against both quantum and classical computers, and can interoperate with existing \\ncommunications protocols and networks.”4 Post -quantum cryptography is critically important to protecting \\nthe Nation’s communication infrastructure, and PQC -related standards, development, and deployment is \\nunderway. However, PQC is distinct from quantum networking  research.  \\nQuantum networks enable applications beyond what is possible with purely classical methods, but they do \\nnot break the laws of physics. Quantum entanglement and the quantum networks that enable its distribution \\ndo not allow the transfer of infor mation faster than the speed of light. And while quantum networks can \\nteleport quantum information, the notion of teleporting material  objects remains firmly in the realm of \\nscience fiction. As a final point of clarification, because quantum networks will likely perform vastly different \\ntasks than classical networks, a quantum internet is not a replacement for the classical internet.  \\nExamples of  Quantum  Networking  Research  Activities  in the United  States  \\nThe Quantum Frontiers Report5 and the website www.quantum.gov6 cite several dozen federally -funded \\nQISE worksho p reports relevant for quantum networking  research . As an early example, the phrase \\nquantum internet  appeared in a 1999 QIS workshop and conference7. More recent research workshops \\ndevoted to quantum networking include the DOE ASCR workshop on quantum networks8; the NSF \\nworkshop on Quantum Interconnects9; the DOE Quantum Internet Blueprint Workshop report10; and \\nthe NASA -NIST workshop on space quantum communications and networks11. \\nInvestment s by several U.S. agencies  over three decades  have seeded and developed  the field of \\nquantum networking.  The variety of research programs  funded by the civilian, defense, and intelligence \\nfunding agencies12 illustrate s how QISE and quantum networking  research aligns with the missions of \\nmultiple agencies.  \\nDepartment of Defense (DOD)  has provided funding for quantum networking R&D  for at least  25 years. \\nA variety of Multidisciplinary University Research Initiatives (MURI) programs  laid a foundation for \\nquantum memories and quantum interconnects .

Furthermore, the DOE recently announced A Blueprint for the \\nQuantum Internet26,27 and increased funding in Fiscal Year 2021 for quantum networking research28. \\nNo single agency can provide all of the approaches and capabilities that are required for accelerated \\nprogress in this field. Building on these activities and research programs will require increased \\ncoordination, as projects get more sophisticated and interconnected.  \\nChallenges  and Goals  \\nThe goal of creating function ing, adaptable, and scalable  quantum networks  to explore a growing range \\nof scientific applications is a formidable endeavor . Quantum networking  research  require s \\nmultidisciplinary expertise  and sustained, coordinated support from multiple agencie s. Above all, the \\npotential benefits to society to build a large quantum network versus the resources required to do so  \\nmust be understood more fully .  \\nIn the near term (1  to 5 year timeframe), core components with benefits across multiple QISE areas are \\nneeded. These components include, but are not limited to, sources, detectors, interconnects, \\ntransducers, and repeaters . Sustained efforts over ten years may be needed for the development of \\nmore  sophisticated  platforms. These  platforms may include novel materials and devices  for quantum \\nmemory, testbeds of various scales, and satellite -based systems  for space -based quantum network \\nlinks .  Additionally , sustained efforts may include  the continued development of quantum algorithms \\nand protocols optimized for quantum network architectures and applications.  \\nThe development of  testbeds capable of distributing entanglement to het erogeneous subsystems (e.g., \\nsolid -state or atomic quantum computers , memory, and sensor nodes)  is aligned with the missions of \\nseveral agencies . Developing  and operating prototypes , both large and small, can answer open \\nquestions about system -level behavi ors, protocols, performance , and applications. Utilizing minimal , \\nor “right -sized”  testbeds, i.e., testbeds  of minimum complexity or scope  to answer the scientific and \\nengineering questions in play , are a means to mitigate risk.   \\nEntanglement distribution over long distances can support applications that differ from those \\naddressed by short -range testbeds; both are important to pursue. Proposed applications for long \\ndistance quantum networking  proving grounds include long -baseline interferometry, space- to-ground \\nquantum networking  for quantum communication , novel sensor arrays for fundamental physics or \\nenvironmental monitoring, and enhanced navigation capabilities29. While these and other ideas need \\nadditional feasibility studies and rigorous research to dev elop, they illustrate the potential and \\nchallenges of large testbeds. As previously noted, QKD does not currently motivate  the U .S. Government \\nto build large quantum networks30; however, QKD can serve to validate the functionality of some \\nsubsystems (e.g., link budgets, timing, and detectors).  \\nExploring potential satellite -mission scenarios  is stimulating research on applications and components \\nsuitable for space -based entangle ment distribution.

The \\napproach of the United States to this scientific pursuit is not directed from the top, but rather is \\ncomprised of efforts spread across several agencies with different missions.  \\nMechanisms  for Coordinatin g Quantum  Networking  Research   \\nThe National Quantum Initiative Act31 calls for the National Science and Technology Council (NSTC) \\nSubcommittee on Quantum Information Science (SCQIS) , with support from the National Quantum \\nCoordination Office (NQCO) , and adv ice from the National Quantum Initiative Advisory Committee \\n(NQIAC) , to coordinate QISE R&D efforts across the Federal government. The NQI program authorizes \\nnew QIS Research Centers and increases to core funding programs in quantum computing, quantum \\nsens ing, quantum networking, supporting technologies, and basic QISE.  In addition, the NQI Act called \\non NIST to establish an industry consortium  which is  realized in the Quantum Economic Development \\nConsortium (QED -C). Recognizing the need to facilitate coordination specifically on quantum \\nnetworking R&D efforts , the SCQIS established the Quantum Networking Interagency Working Group \\n(QN -IWG)  in 2020 with representation from several  agencies  listed in the frontmatter of this report . \\nTo promote U.S. leadership in this emerging field, priority should be placed on foundational science \\nand engineering research that will underpin the development of future quantum networks.  This \\nprioritization is aligned with the National Quantum Initiative Act, the National Strategic Overview for \\nQIS32, and A Strategic Vision for America’s Quantum Networks33. It is also consistent with input from the \\nresearch community, summarized in the Quantum Frontiers Report34. Effective coordination will \\nmitigate risk, accelerate progress, and position U.S. agencies to pioneer new quantum technologies in \\nsupport of their missions.  \\nRecommendations  \\nThe SCQIS, with input from  the QN -IWG , has identified that coordination of basic R&D efforts to exploit \\nquantum  entanglement wi th quantum networks  can accelerate breakthroughs in several QISE fields  \\nand will be a key enabling technology for future quantum information applications . Th e following \\ntechnical and programmatic recommendations  highlight critical steps tha t must be undertaken to \\naccelerate U.S. leadership in quantum networking research.  \\nAgencies should pool their knowledge to determine what minimal testbed functionalities are necessary \\nto address the most pressing questions in quantum networking research .

Expanding  Opportunities  for Quantum  Technologies  to Benefit  Society  \\n“[W]hile the Strategic Overview takes a basic research -driven approach, applied \\nresearch should not be neglected…it is important to accelerate the development of \\nquantum technology toward usable results.  This means balancing pure basic \\nresearch with use -inspired r esearch which is more likely to yield usable \\ntechnology.”  – RFI r esponse  \\nThe nature of information technology is governed by the rules of the universe itself, known as quantum \\nmechanics. This realization helped establish the field of QIS. Presently, n ew technologies that harness  \\nunique quantum properties of coherence, entanglement, and measurement are emerging  from \\nfundamental advances in QIS. Developing practical, real -world applications for these technologies that \\nbenefit other scientists and end -use rs in a wide range of disciplines is now an important frontier for \\nquantum information scientists and technologists. Two major areas of inquiry are key for making \\nprogress  along this frontier : discovering  what is fundamentally possible with quantum technology, \\nincluding  practical quantum advantage s and a deeper understanding  of the classical -quantum trade \\nspace; and engaging  interdisciplinary QIS researchers with domain scientists and end -users early on, to \\nwork together and identify potential applications for QIS technologies and concepts in government,  \\nindustry and other branches of science . \\na. Elucidating F undamental C apabilities of  Quantum Technologies  \\nImproving our  fundamental understanding of how  qua ntum technologies can provide meaningful \\nadvantage s over  conventional classical methods was a recurring theme in RFI responses . This includes: \\nelucidating where improvements can be gained over existing technologies by utilizing quantum \\nphenomena to accomplish specific tasks; characterizing entirely new capabili ties enabled by quantum \\nphenomena that have no classical counterparts; and understanding fundamental advantages for  \\nquantum metrology and quantum computing  that can be derived from quantum networking.  \\nFor quantum computing, RFI respondents noted that  advan ces in computational complexity theory \\ncould clarify  the classes of problems for which quantum computational advantage is possible in \\nprinciple, paving the way for building more useful quantum algorithms  in the long term . In the near  \\nterm, consideration of  non-asymptotic regimes (corresponding to problem sizes that could be \\naddressed by near -term digital quantum computers or simulators) and specific device parameters ( e.g., \\nactual time requirements for quantum gate operations and auxiliary tasks such as sta bilization or error -\\ncorrection protocols) will also be important for such analyses . The development of approaches for \\nmathematically evaluating the potential for quantum advantage in analog quantum computation \\n(quantum annealing, adiabatic quantum computat ion, and quantum emulation)  is also an area for \\nexploration.  \\n“Quantum complexity theory research should be encouraged to understand where \\nquantum computing has the most value and why.

Near -term quantum computers and \\nquantum emulators could be explored to realize transformative approaches with advantages for \\nworking on problems that can be mapped to a q uantum algorithm or to a quantum system for \\ncomputation or simulation.  Developing new quantum algorithms suited to NISQ devices, and formal \\nmethods of resource estimation for evaluating their potential for quantum advantage, could facilitate \\nnear -term prog ress in this frontier . \\n“Applications for NISQ computing are critical for the future of QIS because, in \\naddition to the scientific insights they generate, they form the path to the longer \\nterm goal of fault tolerant quantum computation.”  – RFI response  \\n“What are the NISQ -era algorithms that offer quantum advantage for meaningful \\nproblems?”  – RFI response  \\nb. Engaging QIS  Researchers with Domain Specialists  and E nd-Users  \\nThe need  to identify important real -world tasks for which quantum technologies may offer a promising \\nsolution was a common theme in the RFI responses.

Research areas described in workshop reports and RFI responses include: how \\nqua ntum computational analysis of quantum walks can extend scattering theory; how quantum error \\ncorrection codes and multipartite entanglement can inform searches for new phases of matter and \\ntopological states; and how the anti -de Sitter/conformal field theo ry (AdS/CFT) correspondence and \\nassociated dictionary for translating results can be used to inform quantum gravity theory , and explore \\nproperties of gauge theories at strong coupling where perturbative analysis is not possible . \\nFurthermore, quantum networks and computers can test quantum mechanics in new regimes by \\nexploring fundamental limits for coherence and entanglement . QIS can help explore t he question , \\n“What credible deviations from conventional quantum theory  are experimentally testable?” (e.g., \\ngravitationally induced decoherence, s pontaneous wavefunction collapse m odels , or nonlinear \\ncorrections to the Schroedinger equati on).',\n",

Testing the Standard Model  of Particle Physics  \\nFor fundamental physics, in addition to improvements in gravitational wave detection and  precision \\nmeasure ments of fundamental constants, QIS can provide new  approaches to testing expectations \\nfrom  the standard model of particle physics, and conjectured extensions to that field . Examples include: \\nsearches for dark matter and dark energy; tests of fundamental symmetries such as charge, parity,  time  \\n(CPT) and Lo rentz invariance; and searches for variation of fundamental constants in time or space. QIS \\nmethods such as coherent spectroscopy, atom interferometry, or advanced magnetometry enable \\nsearches for  perman ent electric dipole moments of  fundamental particles  (tests of CP -violating \\nphysics), measurements o f the fine structure constant (useful for tests of quantum electrodynamics), \\nsearches for axion-like particles (dark matter candidates) , and fifth -force searches. This frontier will \\nimprove our understanding o f the foundations of the physical universe.  \\n“Ultra ‑precise measurements of quantum phenomena can be used as extremely powerful \\nprobes of new physics at very high energy scales, e.g., by testing fundamental physical \\nsymmetries and laws, and by searching for  new phenomena such as that associated with \\nthe ‘dark sector. ’ For example, one of the most exciting opportunities at the Quantum \\nFrontier is searches for an electric dipole moment (EDM) of the electron, as well as related \\nquantities in atomic nuclei, whic h arise at a measurable level only from charge ‑parity (CP) \\nviolation beyond that in the Standard Model. ” – DOE Quantum Sensors Report \\nThis frontier recognizes the value of QIS R&D for deepening foundational knowledge, with the potential \\nto yield unexpected  discoveries, new scientific concepts and tools that translate to other disciplines, \\nand yet unknown applications and technologies downstream. QIS research provides opportunities to \\ntest,  refine  and extend  fundamental mathematical and physical theories tha t we use to describe the \\nnature of the universe ; develop a more complete understanding of what can and  cannot be efficiently \\ncomputed; and elucidate the value of quantum resources for  computing, engineering and science itself.',\n",

The breadth of responses and details of R&D pursuits encouraged in the \\nRFI responses and QIS workshop reports provide a broad range of opportunities for research agencies \\nto consider and pursue according to their missions. This community input, received in multiple venues \\nfrom U.S. and worldwide  technical experts, has been organized into eight technical areas identified \\nhere as quantum frontiers . The frontiers are broad areas at the forefront of QIS that contain numerous \\nquantum questions that should be explored early on, and hard technical challenges that must be \\novercome before applications can be developed.  \\nEnsuring sustained American leadership in QIS hinges on coordinating core research programs across \\nthe pillars of QIS U .S. Government  funding: the civilian, intelligence, and defense  agencies. For each \\nmission, the grand challenges and priorities may be different, but there are common hurdles where \\ncoordinated efforts can accelerate progress.

       " \"A STRATEGIC  VISION  FOR AMERICA'S  QUANTUM  NETWORKS  \\n \\n2 \\n  \\nINTRODUCTION  \\nThe Trump Administration is committed to American leadership in quantum information science (QIS) , \\nand to unleashing its incredible potential for U.S. economic growth, technological advancement, and \\nnational security. To coordinate  a national research effort  encompassing Federal agencies, the academic \\ncommunity, and indu stry leaders already underway, The White  House National Quantum Coordination \\nOffice  has released   A Strategic Vision for America’s Quantum Networks . \\nExploring how to build the quantum internet —a vast network of quantum computers  and other quantum \\ndevices —will catalyze new technologies that accel erate today’s internet, improve the security of our \\ncommunications, and allow dramatic advances in computing. By leading the way in quantum networking, \\nAmerica is poised to revolutionize national and financial security, patient privacy, drug discovery, and  the \\ndesign and manufacturing of new materials, while increasing our scientific understanding of the universe.  \\nQuantum computing and networking technologies are still at an early stage of research and development \\n(R&D). The strategic vision focus es America ’s R&D efforts to advance the development of foundations for \\nthe quantum internet. It establishes QIS community  goals  for quantum networking, and recommends six \\nspecific technical areas for focused  research activity.  \\nThis strategic vision is driven by the National Quantum Initiative Act (NQIA) , signed into law by President \\nTrump in December 2018, to accelerate QIS R&D through increased federal investment and coordination. \\nThe strategy was developed through the NQIA’s  coordinating bod ies, the National Quantu m Coordination \\nOffice (NQCO) and the National Science and Technology Council’s Subcommittee on Quantum \\nInformation Science ( SCQIS ) and reflects deep community input from  SCQIS request for information \\nresponses of 2018 -2019 and from  recent workshops hosted b y Federal agencies1,2.  \\nOver the past year, as called for by the NQIA, The White House established the National Quantum \\nCoordination Office to unify Federal R&D activities across government, and the National Quantum \\nInitiative Advisory Committee to ensure perspectives from the quantum community inform Federal \\nefforts. Additionally, to implement the NQIA, the National Science Foundation announced the Quantum \\nLeap Challenge Institutes3 solicitation to explore foundational quantum science and technology, and th e \\nDepartment of Energy (DOE) announced funding for the creation of new QIS research centers4 where \\nresearchers from DOE’s National Labs will join with experts from academia and the private sector to \\nadvance R&D. This builds upon the robust QIS research prog rams, centers and consortia at other agencies \\nincluding National Institute for Standards and Technology, the Department of Defense, the National \\nSecurity Agency, and NASA.  \\nIn 1969, the Department of Defense’s Advanced Research Projects Agency demonstrated the first network \\n(ARPANET) that led to the internet we know today. Back then, one  could hardly imagine that it would \\nbecome the world’s most powerful driver for economic growth and quality of life.   \\nAs demonstrated once by ARPANET and now by A Strategic V ision for America’s Quantum Networks  and the \\nNQIA , the Federal government has a critical role to play in driving early -stage QIS research and providing \\ndirection to national R&D efforts. Under the Trump Administration’s leadership, the United States will \\npioneer the quantum internet and ensure QIS discove ry and innovation that benefits all Americans.  \\n                                                                    \\n1 2019 NSF workshop  on quantum Interconnects, https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.06642   \\n2 2018 DOE workshop  on quantum networks,  https://info.ornl.gov/sites/publications/Files/Pub124247.pdf\",\n",

Research in this area will \\nensure continued advances in fundamental science and enable innovative applications of quantum \\ndevices to improve the Nation’s economy and security. Long -term prospects for quantum networks \\nhinge on our ability to pion eer platforms that reliably link together quantum devices, and to develop \\napplications that leverage quantum -enabled security, sensing, and computation modalities. By making a \\nconcerted and sustained effort to develop these prospects, the foundations for a  quantum internet will \\nbe in place to enhance America’s future.  \\nTwo specific goals will focus efforts in this direction : \\n\\uf0b7 Over the next five years, companies and laboratories in the United States will demonstrate the \\nfoundational science and key technologie s to enable quantum networks, from quantum \\ninterconnects, quantum repeaters, and quantum memories to high -throughput quantum \\nchannels and exploration of space -based entanglement distribution across intercontinental \\ndistances. At the same time, the potentia l impact and improved applications of such systems will \\nbe identified for commercial, scientific, health and national security benefits.  \\n\\uf0b7 Over the next twenty years, quantum internet links will leverage networked quantum devices to \\nenable new capabilities n ot possible with classical technology, while advancing our \\nunderstanding of the role entanglement plays.  \\nWhile pursuing these goals, key opportunities for new directions and spin -off applications will be \\nencouraged by strong coordination and future -looking  leadership under the auspices of the National \\nQuantum Initiative’s coordination mechanisms. This includes both the strong support of federal \\nagencies performing the research and development and also a dedication to using the new technologies \\nand scientifi c discoveries to enhance the execution of agency missions.  \\nAccordingly, the National Science and Technology Council Subcommittee on Quantum Information \\nScience recommends pursuing the following activities, commensurate with our growing understanding \\nof th eir relevance to useful quantum networking and other quantum technology:  \\n\\uf0b7 Technology and platform development for key components including classical sources, \\nquantum -limited detectors, ultra -low loss interconnects, space -to-ground connections, and \\nclassical  networking and cybersecurity protocols and scaling costs ; \\n\\uf0b7 Transduction of quantum sources and signals from optical and telecom regimes to quantum \\ncomputer -relevant domains, including microwaves ; \\n\\uf0b7 Entanglement and hyper -entangled state generation, and trans mission, control, and \\nmeasurement of quantum states ; \\n\\uf0b7 Development of quantum memories and small -scale quantum computers that are compatible \\nwith photon -based quantum bits in the optical or telecom wavelengths ; \\n\\uf0b7 Exploration of novel algorithms and application s for long -range entanglement between small -\\nscale and large -scale quantum processors, including quantum error correction, quantum cloud \\ncomputing protocols, and new quantum sensing modalities ; and  \\n\\uf0b7 Exploration of techniques for both terrestrial and space -based entanglement distribution.\",\n",

          "The key next step will be to develop agency-level plans that address the identified approaches and \npolicy opportunities in the next section, which will be integrated into an overall strategic plan.",
          "It is unlikely that all  of these  barriers can \nbe overcome by any one a gency  acting in isolation, because the science and engineering problems are \ndiverse and  new.",
          "As technology transfer depends on many people in different parts of \ngovernment,  the private sector, and academia,  one approach is to engage  the SCQIS, the NSTC Lab to \nMarket Subcommittee , and their working groups to identify and share best practices .",
          "Similar to the technological arcs \ndescribed by the highlighted exemplars in Section II, these effort s wi ll open new horizons and expand \nthe reach of fundamental science and engineering.",
          "A balanced approach is therefore needed to ensure r esearch \nsecurity while maintaining the core values behind America’s scientific leadership, including openness, \ntransparency, honesty, equity, fair competition, objectivity, and democratic principles.",
          "The \napproach of the United States to this scientific pursuit is not directed from the top, but rather is \ncomprised of efforts spread across several agencies with different missions.",
          "Meanwhile, the \nlong road from basic research  to successful products  requires substantial and sustained funding, often \nwith several coord inated thrusts .",
          "A cohesive, system -\nwide approach is especially important  for R&D efforts that may be too costly for any single a gency , \nuniversity , or company  to sustain on their own.",
          "Start -ups and small \nbusinesses  may benefit from standardized, possibly shared, government pre -approved mechanisms for \nhandling a range of issues from intellectual property to immigration and investor relations .",
          "Computing Community Consortium.",
          "Given  the varied needs of different user communities, a long -term \nstrategy should  be developed to align multiple agencies and unite private sector stakeholders around  \nthe development of  some particular  applications and  key supporting technologies.",
          "• Develop and build  R&D  infrastructure through consortia and foundries.",
          "As the technology evolves, its potential \nimpact on military applications will mean \nthat continual monitoring of export and \ntrade regulations, including the Wassenaar \nArrangement control lists and their \ndomestic implementation in the Export \nAdministration Regulations (EAR) and \nInternational Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR), will be necessary.",
          "The field has \nadvanced in the United States in some part by recruiting, collaborating, an d competing with science \naround the world.",

          "Cross -agency efforts that \navoid redundant investments in costly infrastructure and pre -mature commitments to overly \nconstrained  approaches or modalities is part of the recommended strategy.",
